###Information and questions for OOP

#1 Instance
"""An instance is what the initial object is. 
Ex: a dog instance needs to be created before you can assign the details about it"""

#2 Classes
"""An object is an instance of a class"""

#3 Methods
"""Functions that are defined in a class"""

#4 Initializer
"""Things that are run first when a class object is called"""

#5 Encapsulation
"""Bundling data and methods that work on that data within one unit (Ex. a class)"""

#6 Subclasses
"""The children classes of a parent class"""

#7 Superclasses
"""The parent class that has children classes"""

#8 Inheritance
"""Allows new classes to inherit properties and methods of existing classes."""

#9 Polymorphism
"""Ability for different data types to use the same data structure. 
(Ex. different shapes can inherit from a single shapes class because they share the same features)"""

#10 Composition
"""Classes should use polymorphism to reuse code by composition rather than inheritance"""
