###Goes over fundamental concepts

#1 Recursion
"""A function that has a base case and repeatedly calls itself until it reaches that base case."""

#2 Linear Recursion
"""Makes a single call to itself each time the function runs"""

#3 Tail Recursion
"""Function directly returns the result of the recursive function call"""

#4 Generators
"""Function that creates iterators that return an iterable set of items one a time in a specific way."""

#5 Divide and Conquere
"""Dividing a big problem into smaller problems to be solved"""

#6 Invariant
"""Something that is true every time we reach a certain point in the algorithm"""

#7 Permutation
"""Rearrangement of elements of ordered list into one-to-one correspondence with itself."""

#8 Iteration
"""Set of instructions/structures are repeated in a specified number of times until a condition is met.
