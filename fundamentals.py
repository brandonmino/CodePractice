###Goes over fundamental concepts

#1 Recursion
"""A function that has a base case and repeatedly calls itself until it reaches that base case."""

#2 Linear Recursion
"""Makes a single call to itself each time the function runs"""

#3 Tail Recursion
"""Function directly returns the result of the recursive function call"""

#4 Generators
"""Function that creates iterators that return an iterable set of items one a time in a specific way."""

#3 Divide and Conquere
"""Dividing a big problem into smaller problems to be solved"""
